    <!-- do not require user interaction for the installation of the drivers; this also
         gives us the advantage that we don't need to translate the messages which otherwise

    <suppressWizard/>
    
    <!-- IMPORTANT: we do not want to use the <quietInstall/> tag because as MSDN says:
         "If DPInst is running in quiet-install mode and Windows requires a user interaction to complete 
          an installation, the installation will fail."
         Also, MSDN adds that "two typical situations that require user interaction are if Windows prompts 
         a user before installing an unsigned driver package or if Windows prompts a user for the location 
         of missing files."
         I.e. in our case, since we're delivering an unsigned driver package we need to allow Windows to 
         prompt the user about the fact that he's installing an unsigned driver, otherwise dpinst will fail
         leaving in the log file a message like:
            INFO:   RETURN: DriverPackagePreinstallW  (0xE000022F)
         which means "The third-party INF does not contain digital signature information."
