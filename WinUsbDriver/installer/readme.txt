Steps for releasing XboxBigButton WinUsbDriver on Windows
-----------------------------------------

1) Download and install NSIS v3+ (not version 2).

2) Set ARCH=x86 in setup.nsi and compile it with NSIS; set ARCH=amd64 in setup.nsi and compile it with NSIS.
   Note that you can also use the build_installers.bat batch file to do this step automatically.
